This is a sample of using GraphQL with Next.js, it shows a bit of how routes can easily be built out with GraphQL. 

Next Steps:
Introspect GraphQL and use it to build out all routes and dynamically build the app. This will cause the app to self update whenever new data types are Added to the API if they are connected to existing ones.
